## 1.0.0-fp.66

### Patch Changes

- c14f4ee: DO instrumentation was clearing the metadata field after first instrumented method call

## 1.0.0-fp.65

### Patch Changes

- e0eb37b: Do not throw error if config is not present. It now degrades to a non-recording span instead of throwing.
- df52af0: Do not throw from `BatchTraceSpanProcessor.export` when no instrumentation config is active. It now drops the batch instead, matching the behaviour `WorkerTracer.startSpan` already had — `onEnd` is typically reached inside a `waitUntil` continuation, where throwing rejects the pending promise and can break a Durable Object's input gate.
